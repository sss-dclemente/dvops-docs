Aggregates Power Automate cloud-flow run history (the Dataverse `flowruns`
virtual table) over a time window into a per-flow reliability/performance
table — run counts by status, success rate, p50/p95 (nearest-rank), average and
max duration, last run, and the top error groups — and flags problems: flows
with a high failure rate, flows whose most recent runs all failed (a failure
streak), and flows with a slow p95 runtime. Flow display names are resolved
from the `workflows` table. Reads a single page of up to 5000 runs (newest
first); when the cap is hit the result is marked `truncated`.

## Inputs

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hoursBack` | integer, 1–336 | `72` | How many hours of cloud-flow run history to analyze. |
| `flowId` | string (GUID), optional | — | Scope the analysis to a single cloud flow (its `workflowid`). |

## Example call

```json
{
  "hoursBack": 48,
  "flowId": "aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-00000000000a"

The `table` is sorted by `failed` descending, then `runs` descending.
Percentiles use nearest-rank over each flow's sorted non-null durations; runs
without a recorded duration (e.g. still running or cancelled early) are dropped
from the duration distribution, and a flow with no recorded durations reports
0 for all duration statistics. `successRate` is `succeeded / runs * 100`
rounded to one decimal. `errorGroups` lists the flow's top 3 clusters of failed
runs grouped by error code plus the first 150 characters of the error message,
sorted by count. A run whose flow cannot be resolved in `workflows` gets
`flowName: "unknown"`. When exactly 5000 rows come back the payload includes
`"truncated": true` — narrow `hoursBack` (or scope with `flowId`) for a
complete picture.

Flags are ordered `high-failure-rate`, then `failure-streak`, then `slow-p95`
(worst first within each kind):

- **high-failure-rate** — success rate below 80% across at least 5 runs.
- **failure-streak** — the flow's 3 or more most recent runs all failed,
  which usually points at a systemic break (expired connection, bad flow
  edit) rather than data-dependent errors.
- **slow-p95** — p95 duration above 300000 ms (5 minutes).

## Common errors

**Empty window — run history only covers solution-aware flows**

An empty result is a success payload with a hint, because Dataverse only
records run metadata for solution-aware cloud flows:

```json
{
  "windowHours": 72,
  "totalRuns": 0,
  "flowsAnalyzed": 0,
  "table": [],
  "flags": [],
  "hint": "No cloud-flow runs found in the window. Dataverse run history covers solution-aware flows.",
  "docsUrl": "https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/dataverse/cloud-flow-run-metadata"
}
```

**404 — flowrun table not available**

```json
{
  "error": "Resource not found for the segment 'flowruns'.",
  "hint": "The flowrun table was not found. Cloud-flow run history in Dataverse is a virtual table that only covers solution-aware flows and may not be enabled in this environment.",
  "docsUrl": "https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/dataverse/cloud-flow-run-metadata"
}
```

**403 — missing privilege**

```json
{
  "error": "Principal user (...) is missing prvReadflowrun privilege",
  "hint": "Reading cloud-flow run history requires read privilege on the flowrun table. Use a user with the System Administrator role, or grant the connecting principal read access to Flow Run records.",
  "docsUrl": "https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/dataverse/cloud-flow-run-metadata"
}
```
