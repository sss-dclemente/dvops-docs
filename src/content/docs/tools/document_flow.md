Generates structured documentation for a Power Automate **cloud flow** from its
Dataverse definition (the `clientdata` column of the `workflow` table):

- **Triggers** — type, kind, recurrence schedule (frequency/interval), and for
  connector triggers the `operationId` and connection reference.
- **Actions** — a flat, pre-order outline of the whole action tree with nesting
  `depth`, `runAfter` dependencies, connector operation details, and trimmed
  condition/switch expressions. Containers (`Scope`, `If` with its `else`
  branch, `Switch` with all its cases) are walked recursively.
- **Connectors** — the flow's connection references, deduplicated by API name.
- **markdown** — a ready-to-share markdown document (title, overview, trigger
  list, connectors table, nested action outline).

It complements Microsoft's FlowAgent authoring plugin: FlowAgent helps you
*build* flows, `document_flow` produces shareable *documentation* of what an
existing flow does — for reviews, handovers, and change records.

Caps keep output LLM-friendly: children below nesting depth 5 are omitted (the
container gets a `note`), the action list stops at 200 entries
(`actionsTruncated: true`), expressions are trimmed to 200 chars, and the
markdown is hard-capped at 8000 chars with a trailing `…(truncated)` marker.

**Tier: Pro** — requires the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. Without a
license the tool returns a friendly upgrade message instead of results.

## Inputs

At least one of the two inputs is required. If both are provided, `flowId`
wins.

| Name       | Type          | Required       | Description                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flowId`   | string (GUID) | one of the two | `workflowid` of the cloud flow to document.                                 |
| `flowName` | string        | one of the two | Display name of the cloud flow. Matched exactly first, then as a substring. |

## Example call

```json
{
  "name": "document_flow",
  "arguments": {
    "flowName": "Daily Task Reminder"
  }
}
```

## Common errors

| Situation | Response |
| --------- | -------- |
| No `LICENSE_KEY` set | `{ "upgradeRequired": true, "tool": "document_flow", "message": "...Pro tier...", "docsUrl": "..." }` — the tool never throws on a missing license. |
| Neither input provided | `{ "error": "Provide flowId or flowName", "hint": "..." }` |
| `flowId` does not exist (HTTP 404) | `{ "error": "Flow not found", "hint": "Verify the workflowid (GUID)..." }` |
| No cloud flow matches `flowName` | `{ "error": "Flow not found: \"...\"", "hint": "No cloud flow (category 5) matched that display name..." }` |
| Workflow is not a cloud flow (`category` ≠ 5) | `{ "error": "Not a cloud flow", "hint": "Classic workflows, business process flows and desktop flows are not supported..." }` |
| `clientdata` is null/empty | `{ "error": "Flow definition unavailable", "hint": "The flow may be part of a managed solution without a stored definition..." }` |
| `clientdata` is not valid JSON | `{ "error": "Flow definition could not be parsed", "hint": "Re-save the flow in the Power Automate designer..." }` |
| HTTP 403 from Dataverse | Error envelope with the Dataverse message, a hint that documenting a flow requires read privilege on the Process (`workflow`) table, and `docsUrl` pointing to [cloud flow run metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/dataverse/cloud-flow-run-metadata). |
